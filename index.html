        <ul class="bullet-content">
          <li>
            Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, was born in Lumbini
            (modern-day Nepal) around 563 BCE.
          </li>

          <li>
            He was born into a noble family but renounced his wealth and status
            to seek spiritual enlightenment.
          </li>

          <li>
            Buddha's teachings are centered around the Four Noble Truths: the
            truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of
            suffering, and the path to the cessation of suffering.
          </li>

            Buddha's teachings, known as Buddhism, emphasize the Middle Way—a

            meditation.

          <li>
            The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the Buddha (the teacher), the

            practitioners).
          </li>
